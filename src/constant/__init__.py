    The Global Tech Platform associates are the primary contributors for DX.io, but we welcome contributions from all Walmart organizations as well. Here are ways you can contribute to DX.io:
    1) Create new blogs in DX.io
    Blogs are a great way to share technological insights, case studies, updates about products, or provide general announcements. DX.io provides a simple blog text editor to create new blogs and have them published in
    [DX.io Blogs.](https://dx.walmart.com/blogs)
    Get started and
    [create a new blog](https://dx.walmart.com/blogs/blogpost) now.
    2) Add Documentation in DX.io
    Documentation in DX.io is created using our internal Content Management Solution,
    [HelpDocs](https://etools.helpdocs.io/app/content). The articles must be created in the “DX” folder in their respective sections (e.g. Products, Guides, Services, etc.).
    Get Started with this guide:
    [Add Documentation in DX.io using HelpDocs](/documents/article/1dn24txszm)
    3) Add New Products in the DX.io Catalog
    Products shown in our
    [DX.io Product Catalog](https://dx.walmart.com/products) are created and managed centrally through a UI-based form.
    If you'd like to add a new product, or modify an existing product, please request access by following the
    [Request Access to Add Product to DX.io Catalog](/documents/article/xoebs1sz0v) guide.
    4) Integrate Product into DX Console
    If you have an existing tool or looking to build a new one, you can easily integrate using our DX Console SDK. The DX Console SDK offers UI Templates, API toolkits, and everything you need to bootstrap and launch.
    Learn more about our
    [Product Development Process](/documents/article/nezmomilov) to get started.
    5) Add a Starter Kit
    A starter kit is a compiled set of code that help teams get started with a project and deploy code faster. If you've build an application and would like to share a template for others in Walmart to use,
    [Starter Kit Contributor](https://dx.walmart.com/documents/product/Starter%20Kit%20Contributor/overview) gives you the ability to easily create and publish one into Starter Kit Explorer. View our [Quick Start Guide](https://dx.walmart.com/documents/product/Starter%20Kit%20Contributor/857385746) to get started.

    We made some changes yesterday in Prod CCM for some CRQ. We tried to add the flags on the base config file but, had errors while saving on root config. So, we added the new flag to prod config and also on WALMART-US-B2C config files. When the migration happens, will it override the values from base to these prod and WALMART-US-B2C config files ? please let us knowCommentLikeShare

    [https://console.dx.walmart.com/code/starterkits](https://console.dx.walmart.com/code/starterkits)
    Click create starter kit
    Fill in required fields
    Use tags to improve searchability
    Select all features that will be present in the starter kit

    Read the readme file, download Docker containers to develop and test locally.
    Step Three
    Add new code to template with cookiecutter tokens/etc.
    Cookiecutter transforms the template blueprint into an actual software/component that can be built further. Modify the variables defined in the cookiecutter.json file in the repo that was created from step one.
    To get more information regarding cookiecutter, please reference their documentation. A few articles that should get you started can be found in the links below.

    Step Four
    Create the landing page for your users learn more about your starter kit.
    Before deploying to production, you will need to create an informational page that will be your users' first impression of your starter kit. You should fill out the needed content in each section. An example can be found in the link below.
    Step Five
    When you are ready to deploy your template and / or test your starter kit you will need to commit updates to your main branch. This will pull all the enhancements you have made into the version available on DX.
    Step Six
    Enable your starter kit and select the version you want to make available to your users.
